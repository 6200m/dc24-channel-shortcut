# Disconnect24 Channel Forwarder
A forwarder to the mail patcher. Developed by TheMegaEagle.

## What can I do with this?
So far, this only forwards you to the mail patcher. Any new features that are added to the https://github.com/Disconnect24/dc24-channel GitHub repository will also be added here.

## How can I contribute?
As stated above, this just forwards you to https://github.com/Disconnect24/dc24-channel. If you want new features for the forwarder, you have to commit it to the main DC24 channel repository.

## Warnings & Other Information
While this has been tested by developers; it was only tested on a Wii with Priiloader and on Dolphin Emulator. Therefore, there could be some brick risk. However, to our knowledge, it is fine. Just use Priiloader on your Wii to be safe. This uses the Waninkoko NAND loader to launch, if you wanted to know.
